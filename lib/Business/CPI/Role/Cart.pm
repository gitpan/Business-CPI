=head1 NAME

Business::CPI::Role::Cart - Shopping cart or an order

=head1 VERSION

version 0.923

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Cart class for holding products to be purchased. Don't instantiate this
directly, use L<Business::CPI::Gateway::Base/new_cart> to build it.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 id

The id of the cart, if your application has one set for it.

=head2 gateway_id

The id your gateway has set for this cart, if there is one.

=head2 gateway_fee

The fee your gateway has charged for this cart, if there is one.

=head2 buyer

The person paying for the shopping cart. See L<Business::CPI::Role::Buyer> or
L<Business::CPI::Role::Account>. (This is a bit confusing because the interface
isn't stable yet, and we are planning a transition from the Buyer role to the
Account role. But most CPI gateways still use the Buyer role.)

=head2 discount

Discount to be subtracted from the total amount. Positive number.

=head2 tax

Tax to be added to the total amount. Positive number.

=head2 handling

Handling to be added to the total amount. Positive number.

=head2 shipping

Price of the shipping to be added to the total amount. Positive number.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 get_total_shipping

Traverse all items from this cart and returns the sum of each shipping cost,
plus the value of the shipping attribute.

=head2 get_total_amount

Calculates the total amount of the cart.

=head2 add_item

Create a new L<< Item | Business::CPI::Role::Item >> object with the given
hashref, and add it to cart.

=head2 add_receiver

Create a new L<< Receiver | Business::CPI::Role::Receiver >> object with the
given hashref, and add it to cart.

=head2 get_item

Get item with the given id.

=head2 get_form_to_pay

Takes a payment_id as the only argument, and returns an L<HTML::Element> form,
to submit to the gateway.

=head2 get_checkout_code

Very similar to get_form_to_pay, C<< $cart->get_checkout_code >> will send to
the gateway this cart, and return a token for it, so that the payment will be
made referring to this token. It receives the same arguments as
get_form_to_pay.
